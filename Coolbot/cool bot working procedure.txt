How does it do this?

The HEATER cable (red tip) is keeping your A/C’s sensor warm to make the A/C “think” it is warmer than the actual
room temperature. By doing this, the compressor on your A/C keeps running and cools down the space.
The ROOM and the FIN sensors tell the HEATER when to stop running. When the HEATER turns off, the A/C’s sensor
cools down and shuts off the compressor in response.

If the room temperature reaches the set value, the HEATER will stop running. Your A/C’s Temperature sensor will cool
down and shut the compressor off. 

If the fins of your A/C are reaching the freezing set point (33°F factory default), the HEATER will stop running. Your
A/C’s Temperature sensor will cool down and shut the compressor off to allow for a defrost cycle. This is normal even
if the room has not reached its set point.
